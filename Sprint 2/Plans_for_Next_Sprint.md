# Planning for Sprint 3 

## Sprint Objectives
Goal: At the end of Sprint 3, the system will provide complete functionality for booking vehicles, facilitating the check-in and check-out processes at rental branches. This includes enabling users to sign in, search for vehicles, select rental options, confirm bookings, and manage payments seamlessly. Additionally, the system will implement necessary architecture design requirements, including generating UML diagrams for each process and stubbing/mock data for interactions with external systems.

### To Do items:    
    - Implement user authentication and branch location search.
    - Develop vehicle search, selection, and booking confirmation.
    - Integrate payment processing and generate booking confirmations.
    - Implement employee reservation creation and deposit handling.
    - Develop check-in and check-out processes.
    - Set up email confirmation system.
    - Create mocks/stubs for external systems.
    - Generate UML diagrams and activity diagrams.
    - Integrate rental agreement template and populate with data.
    - Implement indemnification handling.
