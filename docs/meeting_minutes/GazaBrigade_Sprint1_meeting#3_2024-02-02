Feb. 2 Meeting
All team members present.

Decided on rules for contributing:
-	Development branch as intermediary between main branch and new features
-	Naming convention for issues (US-num for user stories)
-	Implement validation from another user to push to development branch and then main branch.
-	Use branches instead of forks.
-	Naming convention for commits, including the nature of the commit.
-	Delete branches after successful merge. (Change setting on github)
-	Scrum master assigns tasks

- 30 minutes
